# CardGameEngine

A simple C++ terminal-based simulation of the card game **Dead Man's Draw**, developed using object-oriented programming principles.

## 🎮 Game Overview

CardGameEngine is a turn-based card game where two players take turns drawing cards from a shared deck. Each card belongs to a unique suit with special effects. Players must choose whether to **keep drawing** or **bank their cards** to avoid busting (drawing two of the same suit).

The game demonstrates:
- Inheritance and polymorphism for card types
- Encapsulation of game state and player logic
- Clear terminal interface for turn-by-turn gameplay

## 🛠 Features

- Fully playable turn-based game in the terminal
- 10 card types with individual effects (e.g., Cannon, Hook, Map, Oracle, Kraken)
- Two-player simulation with score tracking and rounds
- Game logic implemented using clean OOP architecture
